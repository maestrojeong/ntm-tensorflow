    "Neural Turing Machines combined the ability of Turing Machine and Neural Networks to infer simple algorithms. The controller (it's usually a LSTM) can be viewed as CPU and the external memory can be seen as RAM. \n",

    "A NTM has four components: Controller, read heads, write heads, and an external memory. \n",

    "High level overview:\n",
    "1. Addressing: Addressing mechanism is used to produce the weightings of each head. There are two types of adrressing, content based and location based. At every time step, the controller outputs five elements to produce weightings of each head: key vector, key strength, interpolation gate, shift weighting, and a scalar that used to sharpen the weightings. \n",
    "2. Read: each read head has a weighting vector tells how much degree of information we read from on each memory location\n",
    "3. Write: each write head has a weighting vector, an erase vector and an add vector. This is inspired by LSTM's forget gate and input gate. "
