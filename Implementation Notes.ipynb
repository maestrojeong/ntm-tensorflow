    "1. Addressing: Addressing mechanism is used to produce the weightings of each head. There are two types of adrressing, content based and location based. At every time step, the controller outputs five elements to produce weightings of each head: key vector, key strength, interpolation gate, shift weighting, and a scalar that used to sharpen the weightings. \n",
    "2. Read: each read head has a weighting vector tells how much degree of information we read from on each memory location\n",
    "3. Write: each write head has a weighting vector, an erase vector and an add vector. This is inspired by LSTM's forget gate and input gate. More details will be dis"
